        <h3>Stock Trading App</h3>
        <p>
          Diamond Hand Trading gives users a risk-free way to learn about stock
          trading. Users receive fake cash and can modify their portfolio by
          buying and selling stocks, informed by current stock data supplied by
          Finnhub. This full-stack application is coded in TypeScript. The user
          authentication is secured through the use of JSON web tokens. AWS RDS
          manages the Postgres database, and the application is served using an
          AWS Lightsail instance.
